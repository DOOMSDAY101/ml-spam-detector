# **Spam Email Classifier üì©üö´**

This project is a **Spam Email Classifier** that uses **Na√Øve Bayes** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify email messages as spam or not spam. It is built with **scikit-learn**, using **text preprocessing**, **CountVectorizer**, and **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes** to train and evaluate the model. The trained model can then be used for real-time spam detection.

## **Project Overview**
This project:
‚úÖ **Preprocesses email messages** by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and replacing URLs and numbers.  
‚úÖ **Uses a Na√Øve Bayes model** with **CountVectorizer** for feature extraction.  
‚úÖ **Performs hyperparameter tuning** using **GridSearchCV** to optimize model performance.  
‚úÖ **Evaluates the model** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
‚úÖ **Allows users to classify new messages** using a trained spam classifier.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used is a CSV file containing email messages and their corresponding labels (`true` for spam, `false` for non-spam). The file should be structured as follows:

| body                | is_spam |
|---------------------|---------|
| "Win a free iPhone now!" | true    |
| "Meeting at 5 PM, please confirm." | false   |

You should place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
